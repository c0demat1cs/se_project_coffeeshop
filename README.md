  ![custom form](../images/custom_form.png)
- CSS animation and transform
  ![about animation](../images/about_animation.png)

## Plan on improving the project

- The navigation links could be hidden into a dropdown menu.
- Add a fixed button that takes the user to the top of the page.
- Add animation to logo.
- Might include images of the menu items - perhaps a slow-srolling banner at the top of the menu page.
- Background images on each page could reflect more of a coffeeshop theme.
- Add a link to the playlist currently playing in the coffeshop - can be played directly from the broswer.
